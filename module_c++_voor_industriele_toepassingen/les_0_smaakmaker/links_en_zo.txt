Suppose all C++ progs stopped working, then...
All cars would stop, since the MMU’s would fail
Which doesn’t matter because all TomToms would fail as well
Which doesn’t matter because all GPS satellites would drop out
So we’d stay home and watch TV, not Internet, since all routers would fail, as would all browsers
Only nothing nothing on TV, since all powerplants would fail, hence no transmissions
People wearing pacemakers would rather go to hospital then to stay home, since their devices would stop instantly
But being in hospital would be disappointing since all medical diagnostic devices would fail
Which wouldn’t matter since the doors wouldn’t open
Which would be good since the heating would fail
As in fact anything with real time controls like planes and ships
So also trains would be halted, but we’re used to that
In fact we’d run flat out of energy, solar, wind and oil and gas...
